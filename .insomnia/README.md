# Insomnia Workspace

This is my [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) Workspace to work with this API.

You can import the `todolist-backend-laravel.json` file or from [this url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumebriday/todolist-backend-laravel/master/.insomnia/todolist-backend-laravel.json).

## Setup

You need to setup two [environment variables](https://support.insomnia.rest/article/18-environment-variables) before starting.

The `base_url` which is already defined with the default location of this project, but you can change it as you wish.

And the `token_api`, that you can retrieve with the `User/Login` request. Copy the value of the `access_token` in the response preview and past it as the value of the `token_api` environment variable.
